The Student Record Management System is a command-line application developed in C++ to help educational institutions efficiently manage and maintain student records. This project demonstrates proficiency in core C++ concepts, data structures, file handling, and object-oriented programming principles.

Key Features:
1. Student Information Management:
   - Add new student records with personal details (name, roll number).
   - Update existing student records with new information.
   - Delete student records from the system.

2. Academic Record Tracking:
   - Store and manage course enrollment information for each student.
   - Record grades obtained by students in each course.
   - Calculate and display semester/annual grade point averages (GPAs) for students.

3. Attendance Monitoring:
   - Record and update student attendance for each enrolled course.
   - Generate attendance reports for a specified period or course.

4. File I/O Operations:
   - Save student records to a text file for persistent storage.
   - Load student records from a text file into the system.

5. User-friendly Command-line Interface:
   - Provide a menu-driven interface for easy navigation and user interaction.
   - Implement input validation and error handling for various operations.

Technologies/Concepts Used:
- C++ programming language
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Data structures (structs, vectors, pairs)
- File I/O operations (reading/writing text files)
- Basic algorithms (searching, iterating)
- Exception handling
- User input validation

This project showcases the developer's understanding of fundamental C++ concepts, including data structures, file handling, and object-oriented programming. It demonstrates the ability to develop a functional and user-friendly command-line application, which is a valuable skill for entry-level software development roles.

The project's codebase is well-organized and follows best practices, such as modularization and separation of concerns. It serves as a practical example of applying C++ programming skills to solve a real-world problem and can be a valuable addition to a software engineering portfolio or resume.
